                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Jordan Diehl and I'm a photographer! Since picking up photography I've come to love exploring the world and taking pictures of anything that peaks my interest. Most of my photography is nature and landscape photos but I still want to learn more categories of photography so I can keep improving myself in this field. About 5 months ago was when I first picked up photography, and the first camera I bought was a canon 4000 (All the pictures seen on this page are taken with the cannon 4000) and since buying the camera, photography has become one of the very few subjects that I'm truly enthusiastic about and that I want to share with everyone so they can see the beauty of photograpy and the world.</p>
